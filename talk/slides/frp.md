# Functional Reactive Programming

##

FRP is great for managing complex state that changes over time

##

You have first class values that encapsulate state that changes over time

##

Kind of like a souped-up, ultra-composable observer pattern in a library

##

Many things have claimed to be FRP libraries over the years

##

Few have matched the power of the original idea

##

The original idea had two types of things:

>+ Events
>+ Behaviors

##

The original idea had two criteria for implementations to meet:

>+ Precise semantics
>+ Support for continuous time

##

The `reflex` library has:

>+ Events
>+ Behaviors
>+ Dynamics

##

The `reflex` library has:

>+ Precise semantics
>+ Support for discrete time

##

The precise semantics are what makes the code and reasoning about the code composable
