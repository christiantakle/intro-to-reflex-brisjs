# Why Haskell?

##

The `reflex` library is written in Haskell, using GHCJS to compile to Javascript ...

##

... and `reflex` is the best demonstration of why FRP is great for front-end development

##

The `sodium-typescript` library is ready for use now ...

##

... but it doesn't currently have the bells and whistles we need

##

(I can also get more code on a slide with Haskell than with Typescript)

##

We're programmers, and languages are our tools just like libraries are ...

##

... but some of these tools can take a little getting used to
